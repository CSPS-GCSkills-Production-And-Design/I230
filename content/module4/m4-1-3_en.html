<h1>Electronic Discovery</h1>
<section role="content" class="col-md-12">
    <p>In case of special investigations or litigation, you should be aware of electronic discovery, or e-discovery. It deals with the exchange of all relevant information in electronic format, including, but not limited to, emails, documents, presentations, databases, voicemail, audio and video files, social media, web sites, as well as metadata. </p>
    <p>The e-discovery process also includes the gathering, processing, analysis, and eventual production of material. There are various text analytics or text mining tools that can help with the processing and analysis of digital content. All relevant records identified during the e-discovery process are placed under a legal holdâ€”meaning they cannot be modified, deleted, erased or otherwise destroyed.</p>

                <p>The Sedona Conference Working Group on E-Discovery Issues in Canada was formed in 2006.

                <p>E-discovery is a legal requirement that affects information management, as electronic information increasingly contains critical material that may be related to legal actions, audits, or government investigations. Remember that e-discovery is a more complex process than looking for a file or documents for a client or an <abbr title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</abbr> request because of the volume of electronic data produced and stored and the number of stakeholders involved.<p>
