<h2>Stage 4: Use and Dissemination</h2>
    <p>This is the stage at which information resources are used and shared to generate maximum value. The idea is to ensure that program areas are leveraging information resources to the greatest extent possible. </p>
    <p>Stage 4 is critical in supporting Canada’s Open Government initiative and fostering an “open-by-default” culture where information is shared seamlessly across program areas, and timely access is given to those who need it. </p>
    <p>All government employees are encouraged to actively use and share complete and accurate information, in a timely manner, with each other and with the public.</p>
