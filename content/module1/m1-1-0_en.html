<h1>Why Is This Stage Important?</h1>
<section role="content" class="col-md-8">
    <h2>Stage 1: Information Management Planning</h2>
    <p>Stage 1 is the stage where information management (<abbr>IM</abbr>) professionals and managers envision a desired future state for their <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> program, translate this vision into broadly defined goals and objectives, and then outline a sequence of steps for their achievement. This stage ensures that <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> requirements are addressed in departmental planning cycles and then integrated into the design of programs and systems. </p>
    <p>Information is fundamental to the business of government. Having an <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> plan will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ensure that information resources are being properly managed at the outset of a project or initiative</li>
        <li>help senior management determine where to spend money and resources to support your departmentâ€™s <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> program</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Good planning is key to the success of every initiative, large and small. A comprehensive <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> plan can be associated with your entire department, a single program area, or simply a project or initiative.</p>
