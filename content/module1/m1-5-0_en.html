    <p>Good information management practices over time are critical to the maintenance, protection, and preservation of information resources. For example, having a designated corporate repository like <abbr title="GCdocs">GCdocs</abbr> in place will give decision makers timely access to information, while at the same time protecting sensitive information from inadvertent disclosure, and information with archival or historical value from accidental loss or deletion.</p> <!-- THIS IS AN ACTIVITY -->
