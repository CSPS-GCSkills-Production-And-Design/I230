<h2>Stage 7: Evaluation</h2>
    <p>This stage deals with measuring the performance or progress of your department’s <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> program against the predefined criteria outlined in its <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> strategy and plan. The goal at this stage is to foster continuous improvement in <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> activities within your department.</p>
    <p>Evaluating program performance is a key part of the government’s strategy to manage for results. The specific performance goals that were defined in stage 1 (<abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> Planning) are measured. The results become the catalyst for change and improvement, and are realized in various <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> action plans and frameworks.</p>
