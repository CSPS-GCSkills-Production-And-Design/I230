<h1>Metadata and You</h1>
<section role="content" class="col-md-12">
    <p>The information and data held by the Government of Canada are becoming highly structured in electronic formats and in databases. Increasingly, you as an <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr> professional must be a part of a system, program, or service design process from the very start. This will ensure that the metadata needed to meet your department’s business and functional requirements is being gathered and will enable the automation of recordkeeping processes. </p> <!-- THIS IS AN ACTIVITY -->
