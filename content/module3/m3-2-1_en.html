<h1>Numeric Classification Systems</h1>
<section role="content" class="col-md-8">
    <p>In numeric classification systems, information resources are arranged by number, for example, by purchase order, project, case, client number, etc. Numeric classification was used in particular when the information resource to be classified already has an identification number, and when, for reference purposes, the files associated with it bear this same number.</p>
    <p>Duplex-numeric and block-numeric are the two most common subject classification systems currently used in the Government of Canada.</p>

                    <td>The block-numeric system is a hierarchical classification system. Each subject or function is placed in a hierarchy relative to other subjects or functions within the system.<br>The block-numeric system has two parts: part 1 deals with administrative information resources and part 2 deals with operational information resources. A classification number, or a block number, is used to identify each subject or function in the hierarchy. It starts with a primary number (describes a specific subject or function such as general administration, finance, <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr>, etc.), then secondary (classify sub-topics or sub-functions under each primary such as policy, budget), then tertiary, and so on.
</td>
                    <td>The duplex-numeric system is very similar to the block-numeric. In the duplex-numeric system, secondary and tertiary numbers do not normally exceed 12 or 15 each, the maximum being 225 subject files per sub-group. Once the limit of 12 numbers has been reached, file groups should be reorganized.<br> 
While the duplex-numeric system makes it easier to group similar subjects together than does the block-numeric system, expanding it is difficult and requires a great deal of time.</td>
