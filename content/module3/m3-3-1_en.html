                <p>The Government of Canada has adopted a function-based classification approach because:</p> 
                <ul>
                	<li>Functions tend to persist within departments; even if a reorganization of the business or reporting responsibility happens, the department’s overall mandate remains the same</li>
                    <li>Government departments are required to provide evidence that they are carrying out their established mandates; it makes sense to organize information resources based on the functions and activities that are specified in that mandate</li>
