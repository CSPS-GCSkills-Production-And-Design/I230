<h1>Business Process Mapping</h1>
<section role="content" class="col-md-8">
    <p>Another useful tool for developing your information classification system is business process mapping. This is the process of identifying your departmental <abbr title="Information of Business Value">IBV</abbr> based on:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>The business functions</li>
        <li>Who is responsible for <abbr title="Information of Business Value">IBV</abbr></li>
        <li>What policy or legislation <abbr title="Information of Business Value">IBV</abbr> refer to. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Business process mapping will assist your department to become more efficient in maintaining its <abbr title="Information of Business Value">IBV</abbr>, keeping an open-by-default mind frame, and being as transparent as possible to Canadians.</p>
