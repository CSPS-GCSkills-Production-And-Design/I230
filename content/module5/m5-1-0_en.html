<h1>Managing Information Resources</h1>
<section role="content" class="col-md-12">
    <p>Retention and disposition processes control the growth and volume of the information resources generated by business activities. Together, retention and disposition systematically ensure that these resources are:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Relevant, current, and as complete as necessary</li>
        <li>Unfettered by resources that are no longer needed for business purposes</li>
    </ul>
