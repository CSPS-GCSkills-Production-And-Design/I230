<h1>Disposition Authorizations</h1>
<section role="content" class="col-md-8">
    <p><abbr title="Library and Archives Canada">LAC</abbr> has transitioned to new disposition authorizations (<abbr>DAs</abbr>) to ensure that Government of Canada departments benefit from comprehensive disposition coverage under the Library and Archives of Canada Act.</p>
    <p>Select each section below to learn more about <abbr title="Library and Archives of Canada">LAC</abbr>’s approach to disposition.</p>

                <summary class="wb-details">Approach</summary>
                <p>New <abbr title="Disposition authorizations">DAs</abbr> cover all activities carried out by a department, including internal administrative services such as human resource management and information management. The new <abbr title="Disposition authorizations">DA</abbr>s enable departments to apply a single authorization number to all of its records. <abbr title="Disposition Authorities">DA</abbr>s identify, at a high level, activities likely to generate records of archival value and require a validation exercise to determine the list of archival records. Records generated for all other activities may be disposed of immediately. </p>

                <summary class="wb-details">Two-step process</summary>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Government departments provide an operational contact to facilitate access to departmental officials and records. This allows <abbr title="Library and Archives of Canada">LAC</abbr> to develop a <abbr title="Disposition Authorities">DA</abbr> and an associated framework to identify what needs to be documented at the department’s strategic-function level. </p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Departments submit the requested documentation to allow identification of the archival records from the <abbr title="Disposition Authorities">DA</abbr>. This is required only for those program areas where <abbr title="Library and Archives of Canada">LAC</abbr> believes records of historic and archival value are created.</p>

                <summary class="wb-details">Disposition package</summary>
                <p>The new disposition package includes three key parts:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>A Disposition Authorization document, which is the legal authority to dispose of records (similar to recent disposition authorizations)</li>
                    <li>An appendix “Disposition Framework,” which outlines the scope of disposition coverage, identifies areas where archival records are created, and sets out specific requirements for the disposition of records in those areas</li>
                    <li>Documentation from government departments that may be needed in relation to the requirements in the framework</li>
                </ol>
