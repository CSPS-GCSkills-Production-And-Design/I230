<h1>New Disposition Authorizations</h1>
<section role="content" class="col-md-8">
    <p><abbr title="Library and Archives Canada">LAC</abbr> is currently transitioning to new disposition authorizations (<abbr>DAs</abbr>) to ensure that Government of Canada departments benefit from comprehensive disposition coverage under the Library and Archives of Canada Act.</p>
    <p>Select each section below to learn more about <abbr title="Library and Archives of Canada">LAC</abbr>’s new approach to disposition.</p>

            <summary class="wb-details">New approach</summary>
			<p>New <abbr title="Disposition authorizations">DAs</abbr> cover all activities carried out by a department, including internal administrative services such as human resource management and information management. Once a department receives a new <abbr title="Disposition authorizations">DA</abbr>, it will be able to apply a single authorization number to all of its records. New <abbr title="Disposition Authorities">DA</abbr>s will identify, at a high level, activities likely to generate records of archival value and require a validation exercise to determine the list of archival records. Records generated for all other activities may be disposed of immediately. </p>

				<summary class="wb-details">Two-step process</summary>
                 <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Government departments will provide an operational contact to facilitate access to departmental officials and records. This will allow <abbr title="Library and Archives of Canada">LAC</abbr> to develop a <abbr title="Disposition Authorities">DA</abbr> and an associated framework to identify what needs to be documented at the department’s strategic-function level. </p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Departments will submit the requested documentation to allow identification of the archival records from the <abbr title="Disposition Authorities">DA</abbr>. This is required only for those program areas where <abbr title="Library and Archives of Canada">LAC</abbr> believes records of historic and archival value are created.</p>

				<summary class="wb-details">New disposition package</summary>
				<p>The new disposition package will have three key parts:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                	<li>A Disposition Authorization document, which is the legal authority to dispose of records (similar to recent disposition authorizations).</li>
                    <li>An appendix “Disposition Framework,” which will outline the scope of disposition coverage, identify areas where archival records are created, and set out specific requirements for the disposition of records in those areas.</li>
                    <li>Documentation from government departments that may be needed in relation to the requirements in the framework.</li>
                </ol>
